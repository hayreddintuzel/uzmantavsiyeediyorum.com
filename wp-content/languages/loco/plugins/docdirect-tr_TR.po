#. Description of the theme
msgid ""
"DocDirect is a purpose built Directory WordPress template for health care "
"profession. It is designed in a way that it could be used for any directory "
"as it has all the features a directory website may need (and many more!). "
"The current template has been designed with a directory for healthcare "
"establishments in mind. The user can search for Doctors, Hospitals and "
"Pharmacies and also filter them according to their specialties thanks to the "
"unique scrolling search category design. The template is highly elaborate in "
"functionalities and will serve as a perfect directory system with detailed "
"dashboards for service providers outlining their rankings, feedback and "
"number of hits on their profile by users visiting the website in real time. "
"DocDirect also allows for the service providers to subscribe to the "
"website’s advertisement program which allows for them to be featured on top "
"of any relevant search results and in suggestions by the website. Special "
"care has been taken in designing so as to make it general and usable for any "
"other business categories in addition to healthcare providers. The inner "
"pages are carefully designed to provide all the essential information any "
"directory\t business would need."
